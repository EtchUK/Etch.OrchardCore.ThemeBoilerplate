title: Your Theme Pattern Library
---

Welcome to your Play CMS Pattern Library.

A Pattern Library is a form of interactive documentation, that demonstrates the design components available on the current theme of your Play CMS installation. This includes small details, like what individual elements look like, as well as some example static pages that illustrate how these elements come together into components, and ultimately create pages.

Using the navigation on the left hand side of this page, you can browse the designed elements for this theme.

The **Elements** folder contains the most basic building blocks of a website - fonts, colours, and basic HTML entities like image tags, links, and individual form fields.

The **Components** folder contains slightly more elaborate features - elements grafted together for a purpose. For example, where our elements folder demonstrated individual form fields, the components folder imagines what an entire form might look like when put together.

Finally, the **Pages** folder contains full pages, built using the elements and components available. This demonstrates how these features all come together to make an entire web page, such as a homepage, article page, or list page. With your Play CMS installation, you'll be able to flexibly create pages like these, using the components we've provided.

Enjoy your pattern library - it can be useful as a reference when trying to think about the pages you'd like to create, to check what components are likely to be available to you as an editor.

If you have any questions about how to use the library, or how to accomplish your goals with Play CMS, [get in touch](mailto:playteam@etchuk.com).
