<h2>When to use this component</h2>

Use the textarea component when you need to let users enter an amount of text thatâ€™s longer than a single line.

<h2>When not to use this component</h2>

Users can find open-ended questions difficult to answer. It might be better to break up one complex question into a series of simple ones, for example where users can select from options using radios.

<h3>If you need to ask an open question</h3>

Do not use the textarea component if you need to let users enter shorter answers no longer than a single line, such as a phone number or name. In this case, you should use the text input component.
