By default, our "text and image" component outputs as a simple 50/50 double grid with no additional styles. If a more complex layout is required, you can remove the grid divs and apply your own layout by creating a \_text-and-image.scss file in the relevant folder.

You should also consider whether you need to use this component for your layout at all, or whether what you want to achieve can be accomplished by using individual widgets for each column, in a 'flow' in the CMS. Flows typically offer greater flexibility, assuming that the styling is simple.
